Extract discordant mappings.

  For this, alu-detect uses: add-extra-sam-flags and
  filter-mappings. Both take pairing information into account.

  add-extra-sam-flags adds the following flags to SAM field #2:

  - 0x1000: mqv (of this read only) >= minimum mqv (default: 5)

  - 0x2000: mapping left end has tail of >= min_tail_insert_size bp
    (default: 15bp) in cigar ops H/S/I.

  - 0x4000: mapping right end has tail of >= min_tail_insert_size bp
    (default: 15bp) in cigar ops H/S/I.

  - 0x8000: paired mapping is concordant (both reads mapped, correct
    strand position, within min/max fragment size)

  - 0x10000: read length < min_read_len (default: 20bp)

  filter-mappings is used to extract discordant mappings as follows:

  - for unpaired reads, extract mappings: that are unmapped (0x4) or
    have large left/right tail (0x2000 or 0x4000)

  - for paired reads, extract paired mappings where: the pair is not
    mapped concordantly (0/0x8000), or either read has large
    left/right tail (0x2000 or 0x4000).
